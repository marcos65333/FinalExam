### Usage 
-Nagios is important for several reasons:

 * Infrastructure Monitoring: Nagios enables real-time monitoring of IT infrastructure, including servers, networks, services, and applications. This is essential for identifying performance 
   or availability issues before they impact end users.
 * Proactive Alerts: Nagios automatically notifies system administrators of any detected problems or anomalies in the infrastructure. These alerts enable IT operations teams to respond quickly 
   and address issues before they escalate into crises.
 * Downtime Reduction: By proactively detecting and resolving issues, Nagios helps minimize unplanned downtime. This increases the availability of critical business services and applications.
 * Resource Optimization: Nagios enables efficient management of IT resources by providing detailed insights into system performance and utilization. This helps identify areas for improvement 
   and optimize infrastructure capacity.
 * Historical Data and Analysis: Nagios logs monitoring data over time, facilitating trend analysis and long-term planning. This helps identify behavioral patterns and predict future resource 
   needs.
